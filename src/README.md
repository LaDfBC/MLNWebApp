Frontend code for www.mlncenter.com.  

What is this site you ask?  Well, first go to www.reddit.com/baseballbythenumbers.

This is a fake baseball league where folks guess numbers to simulate real baseball games.  The site
facilitates the parts of this league that need record keeping such as results, game state, leadership,
etc.  If you have any questions, contact a moderator on the subreddit or join the Discord!  


Final note: The backend code is in a different repo but it's private since there's some authentication
stuff in there I don't want the world to see.  If you're interested in gaining access to that code or talking to me, you can reach me on:
